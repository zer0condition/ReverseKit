<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Imports information - along with DLL name, function name, and address.</li>
  <li>Intercept all system calls via an instrumentation callback.</li>
  <li>Intercept all commands executed - system(), ShellExecuteEx(), etc.</li>
  <li>Intercept all thread creations - APIs like std::thread, CreateThread(), etc.</li>
  <li>Intercept URLs - APIs like UrlDownloadToFileA and InternetOpenUrlA, etc.</li>
  <li>Threads - lists thread ids along with cpu usage, allows you to suspend them with a button.</li>
  <li>Bypass common debugger checks - CheckRemoteDebugger() and IsDebuggerPresent().</li>
  <li>Anti-BSOD for common usermode BSOD methods which abuse RtlAdjustPrivilege.</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use interface powered by ImGui.</li>
  <li>Hook library with a normal JMP hook and trampoline hook.</li>
</ul>
